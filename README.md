The goal of Computer Vision is to compute **properties of the world from digital images**.  Problems in this field include recovering 3D shapes, estimating motion and object recognition, all through analysis of images and video.  This course provides an introduction to image analysis and computer vision, including such topics as feature detection, image segmentation, motion estimation, image mosaics, 3D vision and object recognition.

These topics will be discussed in terms of algorithms and mathematical tools, from basic principles to deep learning. The applications will be developed in C++. The knowledge of this language is not a prerequisite and part of the course is devoted to its learning.

### Develoment environment ###
OpenCV and C++ using Xcode
